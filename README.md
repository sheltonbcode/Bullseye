#  About Bullseye

Last updated 3/24/23

The Bullseye app is a simple guessing game created with Kodeco in an iOS/SwiftUI course. The point of the game is to match the location of the slider with the random number shown in each round. The closer you get to the number, the more points you'll earn!

Bullseye is currently in development and will be regularly updated until completion.
